      <h1>Taarlo</h1>
      <p>by herman de coninck</p>

      <br>
      <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.
        And in spring too I feel no different.
        We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves
        through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e, </p>
        
        <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.
        We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.
        Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees
        sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>
        
        <p>33, and in the midst of the dark wood
        of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,
        at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>
        
        <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?
        The summer is past, the hay-making is over.
        The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
